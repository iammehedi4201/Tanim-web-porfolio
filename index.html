                 <p>Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. But the cost of such a diagnosis is still limited and very expensive. So, the image processing techniques with the help of deep learning will be useful for early-stage skin disease detection.

                 <p>We have proposed an image processing-based method for skin disease detection. This procedure takes a digital image of the disease affecting the area of ​​the skin, then identifies the type of disease.
